Artificial Intelligence,28-01-2022,SAS,https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html,"Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data."
Artificial Intelligence,28-01-2022,IBM,https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence,"At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data."
Artificial Intelligence,28-01-2022,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[a] Some popular accounts use the term ""artificial intelligence"" to describe machines that mimic ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.[b]"

Artificial Intelligence,28-01-2022,talend,https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-artificial-intelligence/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is waking up and knocking on your door. Almost 60 years in the making, the AI winter — a time with less research and funding allocated toward AI advancements — is over. With 83% of surveyed businesses noting AI as a strategic priority and 75% stating AI as the key to finding new business and ventures, Artificial Intelligence is no longer a product of science fiction. From detecting fraud to efficient hiring methods and predicting machine maintenance, Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming an innovation driver in both the workplace and everyday applications."

AI can not only enable enterprises to better understand current business conditions, but also to predict what will happen in the future and take actions based on those predictions. Today, an increasing number of business users and analysts without formal data science training are harnessing the predictive power of AI through what’s become known as augmented analytics. By automating the simplest parts of the machine learning (ML) process, augmented AI extends model building to a broader range of users including business people, analysts, and developers."

Artificial intelligence is often talked about in conjunction with machine learning or deep learning and big data. This guide will dive deeper into what artificial intelligence is, how it’s used, and what we can expect from it in the future."
Artificial Intelligence,28-01-2022,Geeks for geeks,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence-an-introduction/,"An AI system is composed of an agent and its environment. An agent(e.g., human or robot) is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through effectors. Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions. However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that cannot only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment. Natural language processing gives machines the ability to read and understand human language. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering, and machine translation. Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sensors, etc.) to deduce aspects of the world. e.g., Computer Vision. Concepts such as game theory, decision theory, necessitate that an agent is able to detect and model human emotions. "

Artificial Intelligence,28-01-2022,britannica,https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence,"artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition."
