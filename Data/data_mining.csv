Data Mining,28-01-2022,IBM,https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-mining,"Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets. Given the evolution of data warehousing technology and the growth of big data, adoption of data mining techniques has rapidly accelerated over the last couple of decades, assisting companies by transforming their raw data into useful knowledge. However, despite the fact that that technology continuously evolves to handle data at a large-scale, leaders still face challenges with scalability and automation.

Data mining has improved organizational decision-making through insightful data analyses. The data mining techniques that underpin these analyses can be divided into two main purposes; they can either describe the target dataset or they can predict outcomes through the use of machine learning algorithms. These methods are used to organize and filter data, surfacing the most interesting information, from fraud detection to user behaviors, bottlenecks, and even security breaches.

When combined with data analytics and visualization tools, like Apache Spark, delving into the world of data mining has never been easier and extracting relevant insights has never been faster. Advances within artificial intelligence only continue to expedite adoption across industries.  "
Data Mining,28-01-2022,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining,"Data mining is a process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating."
Data Mining,28-01-2022,Builtin,https://builtin.com/learn/data-mining,"Data mining is the process of transforming large batches of raw data into usable information through the use of software. Data mining can be utilized to uncover insights that lead to better marketing strategies, increased sales, decreased costs and reduced churn, and is dependent on proper data collection and warehousing techniques. Data mining is utilized alongside predictive analysis and machine learning to identify data patterns and investigate opportunities."
Data Mining,28-01-2022,talend,https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-mining/,"Data mining isn’t a new invention that came with the digital age. The concept has been around for over a century, but came into greater public focus in the 1930s. One of the first instances of data mining occurred in 1936, when Alan Turing introduced the idea of a universal machine that could perform computations similar to those of modern-day computers."
Data Mining,28-01-2022,JavaTpoint,https://www.javatpoint.com/data-mining,"Data mining is one of the most useful techniques that help entrepreneurs, researchers, and individuals to extract valuable information from huge sets of data. Data mining is also called Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD). The knowledge discovery process includes Data cleaning, Data integration, Data selection, Data transformation, Data mining, Pattern evaluation, and Knowledge presentation.

Data Mining,28-01-2022,tableau,https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-mining,"Data mining is the process of understanding data through cleaning raw data, finding patterns, creating models, and testing those models. It includes statistics, machine learning, and database systems. Data mining often includes multiple data projects, so it’s easy to confuse it with analytics, data governance, and other data processes. This guide will define data mining, share its benefits and challenges, and review how data mining works. Data mining has a long history. It emerged with computing in the 1960s through the 1980s. Historically, data mining was an intensive manual coding process — and it still involves coding ability and knowledgeable specialists to clean, process, and interpret data mining results today. Data specialists need statistical knowledge and some programming language knowledge to complete data mining techniques accurately. For instance, here are some examples of how companies have used R to answer their data questions. However, some of the manual processes are now able to be automated with repeatable flows, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) systems."

Data Mining,28-01-2022,geeksforgeeks,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-mining/,"Data Mining can be referred to as knowledge mining from data, knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, data archaeology, and data dredging.  It is basically the process carried out for the extraction of useful information from a bulk of data or data warehouses.  One can see that the term itself is a little confusing. In the case of coal or diamond mining, the result of the extraction process is coal or diamond. But in the case of Data Mining, the result of the extraction process is not data!! Instead, data mining results are the patterns and knowledge that we gain at the end of the extraction process. In that sense, we can think of Data Mining as a step in the process of Knowledge Discovery or Knowledge Extraction."
Data Mining,28-01-2022,Logi Analytics,https://www.logianalytics.com/resources/bi-encyclopedia/data-mining/,Data mining is defined as the process of analyzing data from different sources and summarizing it into relevant information that can be used to help increase revenue and decrease costs.
